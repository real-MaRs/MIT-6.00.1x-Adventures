# MIT-6.00.1x-Adventures
MIT's Online Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python Course

# 1/26/17

I learned alot so far from Python syntax, to the basic architecture of a computer. We went over object types, operators, branching, control
flow and more. What I enjoyed the most was when we focused on the core of computer science and broke down what exactly a computer is,
what a program is, and how they are tied together. I liked how each term was thoroughly explained with an easy to understand defintion,
given background information, and an example of its use.
