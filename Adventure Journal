Week 0 - Getting started

Today I installed Python 3.5 and learned how to use the Spyder IDE.f I learned how to print things and ran my first Hello World program
in Python. I made a directory for all the coursework and learned how to create and save files. I also learned how to import libraries such
as matplotlib and numpy which we will use later in the course.

Week 1 - Python Basics

1.1 - Introduction to Python

  1.1.1 - Introduction: Overview of what the course would be about and the topics that will be covered. I learned that computers are actually
  REALLY fast, but not fast enough. We can further optimize speeds by being clever and thinking algorithmically.
  
  1.1.2 - Knowledge: There are different types of knowledge, declarative and imperative. Declarative is simply a state of fact. Imperative is
        a recipe or "how-to". Imperative knowledge is how we will get computers to do things for us.
        
        An algorithm consists:
          1. a squence of steps 
          2. flow of control process that specifies when each step is executed
          3. a means of determining when to stop
