MIT's Online Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python Course 

# 1/25/17

Week 0 - Getting started

Today I installed Python 3.5 and learned how to use the Spyder IDE.f I learned how to print things and ran my first Hello World program
in Python. I made a directory for all the coursework and learned how to create and save files. I also learned how to import libraries such
as matplotlib and numpy which we will use later in the course.

Week 1 - Python Basics

  1.1 - Introduction: Overview of what the course would be about and the topics that will be covered. I learned that computers are actually
  REALLY fast, but not fast enough. We can further optimize speeds by being clever and thinking algorithmically.
