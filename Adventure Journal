Week 0 - Getting started

Today I installed Python 3.5 and learned how to use the Spyder IDE.f I learned how to print things and ran my first Hello World program
in Python. I made a directory for all the coursework and learned how to create and save files. I also learned how to import libraries such
as matplotlib and numpy which we will use later in the course.
