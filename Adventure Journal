MIT's Online Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python Course

Week 0 - Getting started

Today I installed Python 3.5 and learned how to use the Spyder IDE.f I learned how to print things and ran my first Hello World program
in Python. I made a directory for all the coursework and learned how to create and save files. I also learned how to import libraries such
as matplotlib and numpy which we will use later in the course.

Week 1 - Python Basics

1.1 - Introduction to Python

  1.1.1 - Introduction: Overview of what the course would be about and the topics that will be covered. I learned that computers are actually
          REALLY fast, but not fast enough. We can further optimize speeds by being clever and thinking algorithmically.
  
  1.1.2 - Knowledge: There are different types of knowledge, declarative and imperative. Declarative is simply a state of fact. Imperative is
          a recipe or "how-to". Imperative knowledge is how we will get computers to do things for us.
        
          An algorithm consists:
            1. a squence of steps 
            2. flow of control process that specifies when each step is executed
            3. a means of determining when to stop

  1.1.3 - Machines: There are fixed program computers and stored program computers. Fixe program can only do 1 thing (calculator, Alan
          Turling's Bombe). A stored program computer can do many things. They store and execute instructions, you can load into it. There's
          also a special program in a stored program computer called an interpreter.
          
          Basic Machine Architecture
            1. Memory - contains data, sequence of steps; program
            2. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) - takes data from memory, do primitive operations and stores it back into memory
            3. Control Unit - Keeps track of which operation to do in ALU at a point in time. Contains the program counter. The program
               counter points to the sequence of intructions from memory and changes each time ALU computes something.
            4. Input/Output
          
          Basic Primitives:
            1. Turing showed you can compute anything using 6 primitives (move left, move right, scan, read, write, do nothing).
