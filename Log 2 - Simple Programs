  2.1.1 - So Far...: Reviewed what loops and if statements are and went over a guess and check loop. Can slice strings with [start:stop:step]
          Strings are immutable(can't be changed). But strings can be redefined. For loops can loop through strings and numbers.
          ex: number - for variable in range(5:10): (5,6,7,8,9)
--> better    string - for char in s: loop through length of string s                      if char == "a" 
--> meh       string - for index in range(len(s)): loop through length of string s         if index[0] == "a"
          
          word = input("Expecting a string input")
          number = int(input("Expecting a number input")
          
          if(char in string) checks if a character is in a string.
